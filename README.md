INTRODUCTION :
     A tuple is a collection of ordered elements in Python.
        👉 It is similar to a list, but the difference is:
              * Tuple is immutable → once created, you cannot change, add, or remove its elements.
              * Tuples are written with round brackets ().
EXAMPLE : 
    my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, "Apple")
    print(my_tuple)    # OUTPUT : (10, 20, 30, 'Apple')
✨ TYPES OF TUPLE : 
           🚀 Empty Tuple
           🚀 Single-element Tuple
           🚀 Homogeneous Tuple
           🚀 Heterogeneous Tuple
           🚀 Nested Tuple
           🚀 Tuple with Repeated Elements
           
📘 Basic Tuples in Python : 

🍀 Empty Tuple :
          A tuple with no items.
          EXMAPLE : t = ()    
           
🍀 Single-element Tuple : 
          A tuple with only one item (must use a comma).
          EXAMPLE : t = (5,)

🍀Homogeneous Tuple : 
          All items are of the same type.
          EXAMPLE : t = (1, 2, 3, 4)

🍀Heterogeneous Tuple : 
          Items of different types.
          EXAMPLE : t = (1, "Apple", 3.5)

🍀Nested Tuple : 
          A tuple inside another tuple.
          EXAMPLE : t = (1, (2, 3), 4)

🍀Repeated Elements Tuple :
          A tuple with duplicate values.
          EXAMPLE : t = (2, 2, 3, 3, 3)
